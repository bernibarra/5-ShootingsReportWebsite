# a5-data-report

In this assignment, you'll complete the instructions **on Canvas** to demonstrate you ability to leverage `R Markdown` to build a report based on crowd-sourced mass shootings in the U.S. in 2018.  

Please **edit this README.md** file to include a link to your hosted report (this will **earn you points** and make **grading easier**). When you're finished, please make sure to **submit this GitHub URL** to Canvas on time for credit.
